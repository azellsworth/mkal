# mkal
NPM module - easily save bash aliases for directories

## Overview

mkal is an npm module that lets you easily save aliases for folders in your command line.

For example, if you are in a directory, just type: 
```sh
mkal [alias name]
```

Where [alias name] is whatever you want to be your shortcut.

Then, from any directory, you can type in [alias name] and it will take you directly to that folder.

## Installation

If you have npm installed in your command line, just type in:

```sh
npm install -g mkal
```


## Contributions

We would love to get your help making this little package as useful as possible. We are open to all suggestions, and please feel free to submit pull requests. 
Also, if you have alternative suggestions for a name, we are all ears. mkal (which stands for make alias) is a little hard to remember. 
If you have an idea for a new name, and it's available on npm, let us know!
